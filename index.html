        Life is a beautiful journey that is meant to be embraced to the fullest
        every day. However, that doesn't mean you always wake up ready to seize
        the day, and sometimes need a reminder that life is a great gift.
        Whether a funny quote from a famous celebrity or an encouraging message
        about giving it your best from a successful business person, we can all
        use a little motivation and inspiration these days via a life quote.

        Paragraphs are medium-sized units of writing, longer than sentences, but
        shorter than sections, chapters, or entire works. Because they connect
        the “small” ideas of individual sentences to a “bigger” idea, paragraph
        structure is essential to any writing for organization, flow, and
        comprehension. Students have a lot of questions when it comes to writing
        a paragraph: How many sentences should you use? How do you transition
        within a paragraph? When do you end a paragraph? Etc. Below we explain
        everything you need to know about paragraph structure to write like an
        expert, including several paragraph examples.

        Before we dive into paragraph structure, let’s start with paragraph
        meaning. A paragraph is an individual segment of writing that discusses
        a central idea, typically with more than one sentence. It even has its
        own paragraph symbol in copyediting, called the pilcrow (¶), not to be
        confused with the section symbol called the silcrow (§) that’s common in
        legal code. Here we focus mainly on paragraph structure, but feel free
        to read our ultimate guide to paragraphs for more of the basics.
